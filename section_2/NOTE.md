# Section 2 - Quick install guide

- The quick install guide for Django explains how to install Python and Django.
- Users have three options for installing Django: an official release, a version provided by their operating system distribution, or the latest development version.
- If working with a large database engine like PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, or Oracle, additional installation steps may be necessary.
- To verify Django is installed correctly, users can import it in Python and check the version number.
